Implement an allocator and deallocator for a two-dimensional array
library that supports double-subscripting for accessing elements.  The
goal is to minimize the number of calls to stdlib functions.  See the
conditional code based on the DOUBLE_SUBSCR preprocessor symbol.

The existing typedefs and function signatures should not change.  Only
the definitions of alloc2d() and free2d() should.

Use "make DOUBLE_SUBSCR=1 && ./main" to build and test the
double-subscript 2D array implementation.  "make
SINGLE_SUBSCR_SAVED_COL_SZ=1" builds an implementation using a
single-dimensional array which also carries the column size.  It's
there only as a reference.
