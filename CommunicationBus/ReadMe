See UnitTest directory for the associated test code.  Run by calling "make" within this directory.  CppUTest and FFF submodules must be installed.
Unit Tests were mainly developed to test faking out production code, and how to test text output without having to manually parse the screen.

The code developed in the production code is under BUS0_IRQHandler and vTaskBus0.  Some reformatting and shifting around of functions were made.
